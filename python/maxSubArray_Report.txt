<2: Max Sub Array Report>

Implementation:

<I chose Python to implementation the algorithms. It was very easy to read and code in Python by just following the book's algorithm.
First, I tested with command line input n and the example we worked in class before testing it from bash script.>


Testing Expectations:
<My exception was that it will return low, high, and sum from n random data. I expected similar results as the in class example. It was straight forward>


Testing Observations:
<I observed that it the timing for every n was closing to each other. A graph is increasing at a decent speed and it levels off. It doesnâ€™t looks like blogs though> 


Analysis:
<I expected the graph should look like nlogn, but it is not. >

Take-Away:
<I took away that finding a max sub array was really fast. >
