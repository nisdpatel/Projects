<2: Bubble and Selection Sort Report>

Implementation:

<I chose Python to implementation the algorithms. It was very easy to read and code in Python by just following the book's algorithm.
First, I tested with command line input n before testing it from bash script.>


Testing Expectations:
<I expected almost same results as I have on the graph. I expected overlapping. I wasn’t sure how compact the graphs are going to be.>


Testing Observations:
<Clearly, selection sort is more compact than the bubble sort. However, with bubble sort when I used random numbers, the graph was going up and suddenly it started decreasing after n = 8000 which was a bit odd and it slowly started increasing  when n =8500.> 


Analysis:
<It matched my exceptions. I had expected overlapping. I didn’t know how compact it would be until I plotted the points. I knew it was O(n^2).>

Take-Away:
<I took way that both algorithms were O(n^2), and the results were what I had expected. There wasn’t anything shocking.>
