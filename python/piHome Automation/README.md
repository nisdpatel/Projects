PiHome Automation is a smart home monitoring project that we are developing.  
It consist of a couple of Raspberry Piâ€™s running some open source and custom software to monitor your house using video cameras and sensors.  
Using the cameras and door and motion sensors the system notifies the user via text messages and/or email when when someone is intruding. 
The system also allows for live streaming from a web page and includes a doorbell feature.
The doorbell feature includes user interface, proximity lights, and buttonless doorbell that allows guests to record and email a video when no one is home.
